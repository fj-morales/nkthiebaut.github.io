    "# Few-shot learning on textual data with siamese neural networks\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're doing machine learning and meet a classification problem with many categories and few examples per category, it is usually thought that you're in trouble 😨. Acquiring new data to solve this issue is not always easy or even doable. Luckily, we'll see that efficient techniques exist to deal with this situation 🕺. \n",
    "\n",
    "This problem of learning with only a few examples per category is called \"few-shot learning\", and \"one-shot learning\" in the extreme case of only one example per class (yes, you can even do this and [obtain decent results](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rsalakhu/papers/oneshot1.pdf)!). \n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the machine learning research on one-shot learning involves images, but some [recent research papers](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.10280) address the same problem in the Natural Language Processing (NLP) realm.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this blog post, I will use siamese neural network to tackle few-shot learning, following a [method that was originally applied to images](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rsalakhu/papers/oneshot1.pdf) and that is nicely explained [here](https://sorenbouma.github.io/blog/oneshot/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Job title classification provides a good example of a few-shot learning problem in NLP. Say you want to group job titles in different categories or \"occupations\" (e.g. gather \"Programmer\" and \"Software engineer\" in an occupation, and \"Sales manager\" in another one), then unless you have hundreds of job titles examples per occupation you are facing a few-shot learning problem. The U.S government provides such a job title/occupations taxonomy: the [Standard Occupational Classification](https://www.bls.gov/soc/). I'll use it as a toy dataset understand how few-shot learning with siamese neural networks works.\n",

    "Let's start by downloading the taxonomy and check what's in there."

Using word representations learnt in an unsupervised setting on a bigger dataset is the basic principle of [transfer learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_learning) and reduces the overfit by allowing smaller models to perform well, utltimately giving better performances on the test set.\n",
