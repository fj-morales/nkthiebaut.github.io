:summary: Nicolas Thiebaut resume

I am a machine learning engineer at `Visage <https://www.visage.jobs>`_, a San Francisco based startup specialized in recruiting. Before that I have worked two years as a data science consultant for `Quantmetry <https://www.quantmetry.com>`_. I also have a PhD in Theoretical Physics focused on the Fractional Quantum Hall effect. You can download the manuscript `here <https://www.theses.fr/2015PA112050>`_ if you can read French!

Beside I am fond of all kind of sports, from soccer to muay thai, I enjoy playing jazz on the piano, and I can juggle with 5 balls :).
