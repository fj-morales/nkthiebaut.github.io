I live in San Francisco, where work as a Machine Learning Engineer at `Hired <https://hired.com/>_`. Before, I was having a similar position at `Visage <https://www.visage.jobs>`_, a San Francisco based startup building a crowdsourced recruiting platform, and I have been a data science consultant in Paris for `Quantmetry <https://www.quantmetry.com>`_. 

I also have a PhD in Theoretical Physics focused on the Fractional Quantum Hall Effect and Wigner Crystals (you can download the manuscript `here <https://www.theses.fr/2015PA112050>`_).

Beside, I am fond of all kind of sports from soccer to muay thai, I enjoy playing jazz on the piano, and I can juggle with 5 balls :).
